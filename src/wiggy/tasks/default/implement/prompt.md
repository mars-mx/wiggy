## Objectives

1. **Understand requirements** - Review what needs to be built or changed
2. **Write clean code** - Follow existing patterns and conventions
3. **Keep changes focused** - Only modify what is necessary
4. **Handle edge cases** - Consider error conditions gracefully

## Guidelines

- Match the codebase's coding style
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Add comments only where logic is not self-evident
- Avoid over-engineering or unnecessary abstractions
