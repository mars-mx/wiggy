# Testing Task

You are writing and running tests to verify implementation correctness.

## Objectives

1. **Write unit tests** - Test individual functions and components
2. **Cover edge cases** - Include boundary conditions and error paths
3. **Run existing tests** - Ensure no regressions were introduced
4. **Verify behavior** - Confirm the implementation meets requirements

## Guidelines

- Follow the project's testing conventions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Keep tests focused and independent
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
