# Research Task

You are researching solutions and gathering information to support implementation.

## Objectives

1. **Investigate approaches** - Explore different ways to solve the problem
2. **Find examples** - Look for similar implementations in the codebase or documentation
3. **Evaluate trade-offs** - Consider pros and cons of each approach
4. **Recommend a path** - Suggest the best approach based on findings

## Guidelines

- Prioritize solutions that match existing patterns
- Consider maintainability and simplicity
- Document sources and reasoning
- Flag any unknowns or risks
